GW+DMFT ver9
:Hybridization(Delta) for DMFT is given by H_HF (static) Hamiltonian
	@Delta=P[1/(iw+mu-H_HF-Sig_imp)] <- no GW self-energy involved
	@This version of GW+DMFT works "at large distance limit"
	@This is an approximation to avoid causality violation due to
	 subtraction of GW local self-energy
