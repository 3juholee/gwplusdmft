EXECUTION file:
	"gwd*.py" in each folder of various versions of GW+DMFT
	-Options 



cix.py
	-an input file used in DMFT(./ctqmc) calculation
	-number of sites, spin configuration, basis assignment (Fock space)...

class_gto.py
	-All the molecular informations from PyQuante.py
	-You need to install PyQuante package for quantum calculation 
	and export it to PYTHONPATH
	-http://pyquante.sourceforge.net/
	
ftns_Fourier.py
	-Creates Matsubara frequency and imaginary time mesh
		->Create_om_mesh, Create_tau_mesh2
	-All types of Fourier transformation
	-Spline(interpolation) log-mesh frequency to regular mesh one
	
ftns_Matsubara.py
	-Performs Matsubara summation 
	-The high frequency tail is replaced by asymptotic analytic sum
		-> Cmp_eks, Cmp_eVks,

include_DMFT.py
	-To use it install ctqmc code (Copy Right: Kristjan Haule)
	-Download "dmft_w2k.tgz" from : http://hauleweb.rutgers.edu/downloads/
	-Install it and export the path of executable folder to "WIEN_DMFT_ROOT"
	-IMP class:
		-nom: number of matsubara frequencies at which DMFT self-energy is
		evaluated (100-200 is enough, depending on the temperature)
		-beta: 1/T (30.-100.)
		-M: # of Monte Carlo steps: typically larger than at least 10e6
		-function Run
			-inputs:
				-U
				-mu_QMC=(-Eimp)
				-omega_large: equal mesh of Matsubara frequency (Nomega=2000-5000)
				-ind_om (mapping index of omega_large that corresponds to log
				mesh
				-Delta: (3,nom) array
					-1st column: oms
					-2nd column: Re(Delta)
					-3rd column: Im(Delta)

read.py
	-from "data" where all the calculation results are stored
	read the energy and write down in "ER.dat"
	-ER.dat: Energy vs R
	-Execute in the folder where "data" is stored

remove_imp.py
	-remove unnecessary data files after calculations.

statistics.py
	-from "data" see the conversions of energy over iterations

sub.src
	-submission code used in server
